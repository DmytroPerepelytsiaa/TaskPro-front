# TaskPro

TaskPro is a full-stack application developed with NestJS on the backend and Angular on the frontend. It serves as a responsive to-do list application, fully optimized for all device types. The application includes a secure authentication and login system, along with support for multiple visual themes, allowing users to personalize their experience. Users can create dashboards that contain columns and task cards, each with customizable titles, priorities, and due dates. One of the features of TaskPro is its customization - users can choose from predefined dashboard backgrounds or upload their avatar, which will then be uploaded to Cloudinary. The interface combines components from Angular Material and is styled using Tailwind CSS.

The FE side is deployed on the Netlify service, and the BE side with the database was deployed using Railway.
